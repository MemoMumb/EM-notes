# AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism

This is a series of "lecture" notes that I took based on various material sources so that I (and potentially you) can understand the physics c e&m curriculum better. The information may or may not be correct: if you find any mistakes, please don't hesitate to message me and I will try to corret it ASAP.

To see the notes, navigate to the desired folder and open the pdf document.
If you really want to, you can also look at the .tex file to see all of the bad formatting decisions I have made.
